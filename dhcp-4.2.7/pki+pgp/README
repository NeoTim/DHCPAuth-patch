The ISC DHCP is licensed under ISC license.

The linked libraries have the following licenses:
	* OpenSSL - OpenSSL license 
	* GnuPG (GPGME, Libgpg-error) - GPL/LGPL

Because OpenSSL license is incompatible with GPL/LGPL, the DHCPAuth module code 
is split into two parts (patches):
	* PKI (uses OpenSSL) licensed under ISC  
	* PGP (uses GnuPG) licensed under GPL

To build the full DHCPAuth module apply one of the patches and then add the 
missing parts of the other patch.
